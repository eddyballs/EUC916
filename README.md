Working in EUC can be very difficult at times. The end user compute space has evolved so fast in such a short period of time that those that have been involved in this sometimes frustrating space of IT, know that things are now easier than they've ever been.

Some of these scripts were either written by me, either alone or in collaboration with coworkers...or taken from smarter people on the internet. Keep in mind that some of these scripts from the internet will always have the original author's notes, or have the proper acknowledgement and source of where it came from (if I can find it, and if it still exists of course).

All of these scripts should be executed AT YOUR OWN RISK! Please run these in a test environment, with extreme care, and/or with someone you don't like and then blame them if things go wrong >:]
